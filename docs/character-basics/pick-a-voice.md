A memorable voice cements the persona you just defined. Drawhisper’s voice creation flow keeps things fast—plan for one minute of work and a 15-second sample.

## Capture the demo audio
1. **Script the sample**: Write 2–3 lines that showcase the character’s tone and a quick emotional shift.
2. **Record in a quiet space**: Mobile microphones work if you reduce background hum.
3. **Stay on-brand**: Use the same catchphrases or metaphors from the character prompt so the model learns the right cadence.

> Tip: Aim for 15–20 seconds; longer clips slow processing without noticeably improving quality.

## Transcribe with intent
- Provide the exact transcript in the upload form so the voice model can map phonemes accurately.
- Mark pauses with ellipses (…) and emphasis with ALL CAPS if it’s critical to the character.

## Create the voice profile
1. Upload the audio (`.wav` preferred) and paste the transcript.
2. Name the voice or add a descriptive label (e.g., `Maris — Warm Orbital Guide`).
3. Choose **Voice Style Preset** if you want extra polish (whisper, broadcast, animated) and test the preview.

## Assign it to the character
- Open the character settings and select your new voice in the **Primary Voice** dropdown.
- Add fallback voices if the scene requires alternative moods (e.g., emergency comms vs. casual chat).
- Document the voice name inside the character profile so teammates reuse it.

Next up: animations that sync perfectly with this new voice.
