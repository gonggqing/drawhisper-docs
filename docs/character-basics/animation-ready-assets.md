Delivering clean, organized layers makes the animation process painless.

## Layer checklist
- Separate head, torso, limbs, and accessories into their own groups.
- Use consistent naming conventions so riggers can map bones quickly.
- Keep transparent backgrounds and avoid merging shading into base layers.

## Format guidelines
Export PSD files at 2048 px height. For Live2D, include a JSON manifest referencing each texture.

## Collaboration tips
Share asset packs via the project drive and notify animators of any stylistic constraints or physics requirements.
