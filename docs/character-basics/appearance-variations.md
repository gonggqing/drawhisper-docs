Your characterâ€™s appearance can evolve with each campaign or storyline.

## Outfit slots
Create modular outfits that can be toggled per scene. Name them clearly so collaborators know when to use each look.

## Expression sets
Prepare at least five expressions (neutral, happy, surprised, determined, sad) so the AI can emote convincingly.

## Testing updates
Use the previewer to confirm that mouth and eye layers align before publishing changes.
