You’ve built the character, scene, voice, animations, and flow—now it’s time to see it all come alive.

## Launch checklist
- **Publish the flow** and confirm it’s tagged for the right workspace or channel.
- **Enable sentiment overlays** so users can see expression shifts in real time (optional but great for demos).
- **Set chat availability** (public, invite-only, or QA sandbox) before sharing links.

## Run the immersive preview
1. Open the chat view and select your new flow from the dropdown.
2. Trigger each sentiment path to confirm the right animations and voice clips fire.
3. Check that scene lighting, audio levels, and avatar transitions feel seamless.

## Share the experience
- Announce the launch in your community spaces or project hub.
- Collect transcripts and reaction metrics during the first 24 hours to spot potential refinements.
- Keep a change log so future updates preserve what fans already love.

**Congratulations!** You now have an advanced AI companion with:
- Sentiment-aware dialogue routing.
- Animation-driven expression syncing (Spine by default, Live2D optional).
- A story-rich scene and voice that stay true to the original character.

When you’re ready to iterate, hop back to any previous step and expand the universe.
