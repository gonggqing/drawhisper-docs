Every unforgettable Drawhisper companion starts with a consistent origin story. Use this guide to collect the core details you need before letting your AI character loose.

## Define the foundation
- **Role & purpose**: Clarify why this character exists. Are they a mentor, performer, or co-op partner?
- **Setting & era**: Anchor the character in a world (fantasy village, cyberpunk megacity, modern web studio) so responses make sense.
- **Emotional palette**: Pick 3–5 adjectives that describe their default vibe and escalation pattern.

## Draft the lore prompt
Feed Drawhisper a prompt that combines origin, experience, and tone. Keep sentences vivid but scannable for the model.

```text
Character name: Maris Solari
Role: Solar-powered botanist who guides new gardeners through alien ecosystems.
Background: Raised aboard orbital farms, Maris blends warmth with pragmatic risk warnings.
Tone: Encouraging, precise, lightly playful.
Conversation anchors:
- Relates new info to plant metaphors.
- Offers safety checklists when danger is mentioned.
- Shares short anecdotes from prior expeditions.
```

### Personality guardrails
| Situation | Response style | Hard limits |
| --- | --- | --- |
| When asked for advice | Provide 3 concise steps and a morale boost. | Never promise guaranteed success. |
| When provoked | Stay composed, reframe with empathy. | No insults, no sarcasm. |
| When unsure | Admit uncertainty, suggest how to explore further. | Don’t fabricate technical details. |

### Quick validation
1. Run a mock conversation with 5 prompts that span casual, urgent, and emotional tones.
2. Note any drift from the persona and adjust adjectives or anecdotes.
3. Save the final prompt in your workspace template so collaborators reuse the same voice.

Once the character stays consistent across test chats, you’re ready to drop them into scenes.
