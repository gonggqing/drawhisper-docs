Scenes are where your character’s lore becomes tangible. A well-designed setting amplifies their personality without rewriting it.

## Carry the essence forward
- **Echo the core traits**: If the character is calm and patient, avoid chaotic backdrops unless you’re highlighting contrast.
- **Preserve priorities**: Reuse the same motivations and goals you defined in the character prompt. Scenes should deepen—not replace—what makes them unique.
- **Surface recurring motifs**: Symbols, colors, or catchphrases remind fans who they’re interacting with.

## Scene prompt checklist
1. **Context snapshot**: Two sentences that describe where the scene sits in the timeline.
2. **Spatial cues**: Name key props, lighting, and focal points; specify interactable zones for the flow canvas.
3. **Emotional stakes**: Explain why the character cares about this moment.
4. **Interaction hooks**: Suggest 2–3 user actions or questions the character can latch onto.

```text
Scene name: Aurora Vault Observation Deck
Timeline: Immediately after Maris secures a rare radiant seed.
Setting: Panoramic dome with suspended hydroponic vines, low ambient gold lighting, control consoles on either side.
Emotional stakes: Maris balances excitement with vigilance over seed stability.
Interaction hooks:
- Inspect the containment pod.
- Ask about the star-chart overlay on the glass.
- Discuss the risks of transporting radiant flora planetside.
```

## Connect the scene to flows
- Tag the scene with the same character ID so expressions and voice packs auto-load.
- Flag **inherit tone** and **inherit safe responses** to reuse persona guardrails.
- Attach relevant assets (concept art, lighting references) so animators and writers stay aligned.

With the scene locked, you’re ready to focus on how the character will sound.
