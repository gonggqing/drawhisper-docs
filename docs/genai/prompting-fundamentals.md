Effective prompting balances creativity with clarity.

## Framework
- **Context** — describe the scenario and characters involved.
- **Style** — reference artistic inspirations, genres, or emotions.
- **Constraints** — set limits for length, pacing, or camera movements.

## Reference assets
Attach mood boards, audio snippets, or storyboard frames to anchor results.

## Iteration loops
Review drafts, provide inline notes, and rerun with incremental adjustments rather than starting from scratch.
