description: Chain GenAI tasks together with Flow scripts and triggers.
---

Automate repetitive tasks so you can focus on high-level direction.

## Flow building blocks
- **Inputs**: designate characters, scenes, or assets to feed into each step.
- **Processors**: choose the GenAI models for writing, illustration, or motion.
- **Outputs**: specify where results are stored and who reviews them.

## Trigger strategies
Kick off flows on a schedule, on asset uploads, or via webhook calls from your own tools.

## Monitoring
Use run logs to catch failures early and requeue only the affected segments.
