# Drawhisper Creator Book

**Welcome to Drawhisper, where creativity meets AI and inspiration begins** ❤️. Whether you’re an artist, animator, or storyteller, this guide will walk you through the essential steps to begin your journey as a creator on the platform.

Step into a world of characters created by our community. If you’re ready to extend your favoriate character's story or bring your own OC (original character) to life, this guide will lead the way.

## Getting Started
#### *Character*
Drawhisper offers a suite of creation tools designed to **empower and inspire creators** on their journey. Begin by crafting your character — **a spark of imagination brought to life in moments**. Prompting its background stories, creating its appearence via [Creator Center](/docs/genai/) instantly powered by AI. Once created, you can review or edit your character in **personal home**, ready to grow through the stories you design.

#### *Scene and Animation*
From there, the Creator Tools open the door to **worldbuilding**. Compose new **scenes** that expand your character’s journey, inheriting their core essence while branching into new narratives. For animation, we support both **Spine** and **Live2D** — two expressive styles that bring **movements** and **emotions** to your characters. You can explore their unique qualities in the [Animations](./character-basics/draw-animations.md) section.
#### *Anime Flow*
Once your characters and animations are in place, the [Animation Flow](./character-basics/assemble-a-flow.md) guide shows you how to orchestrate their story and personality — **shaping how they feel, move, and speak**. This visual flow editor, powered by advanced AI, breathes soul into your creation, crafting deeply interactive and emotionally resonant experiences.
#### *Voice*
And if voice is part of your vision, the [Voice](./character-basics/pick-a-voice.md) guide makes it possible to replicate your voice — or evoke another — using just **a few seconds of audio and reference text**. It’s a bridge between expression and presence, allowing your creations to speak, whisper, and connect like never before.

## Attributes to define the chracter

In drawhisper, every character’s interaction is shaped by a blend of **creative elements** and **user dynamics**. There are three core components that guide how a character **feels, responds, and behaves**:
- Character Profile
The character’s soul — including their name, description, avatar, background story, greeting, and seed chat — forms their **tone, personality, and initial intent**.
- Scene Settings 
Each scene sets the **emotional stage** — with its own avatar and introduction — influencing the **atmosphere** and **context** of interactions.
- User Persona
The user’s role in the story — a default or **custom identity** that defines how the character sees and engages with them.

These three elements weave together to shape the soul of a character — guiding how they **speak, feel, and connect**. Though scene settings and user personas are optional, they lend nuance and shade to the tapestry of interaction. As story **unfold and voices intertwine**, your character evolves — guided not just by design, but by the **shifting context of every interaction**.
