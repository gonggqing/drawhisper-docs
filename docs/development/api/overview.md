The Drawhisper API lets you automate creative workflows, sync assets, and orchestrate AI-assisted editing directly from your own applications.

## What you can do

- ðŸŽ¨ **Manage creative projects** â€” create, update, and archive projects in real time.
- ðŸ§  **Trigger AI render jobs** â€” queue generations, monitor their status, and fetch results programmatically.
- ðŸ”„ **Sync assets** â€” upload source files, retrieve final renders, and keep metadata in sync with Drawhisper libraries.
- ðŸ“¡ **React to events** â€” subscribe to webhooks for project updates, render completions, and review feedback.

## Quick start checklist

1. Request API credentials from the Drawhisper workspace admin.
2. Add your client ID and secret to a secure secrets manager.
3. Review the authentication flow and grab a short-lived access token.
4. Call the `/v1/projects` endpoint to confirm your integration is wired up.
