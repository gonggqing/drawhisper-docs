Keep your subscription operations smooth by delegating responsibilities.

## Role types
- **Owner**: full control over tiers, payouts, and team membership.
- **Manager**: can publish perks and respond to supporter messages.
- **Support**: handles customer issues without accessing financial settings.

## Security best practices
Require 2FA for all team members, audit access quarterly, and remove inactive collaborators promptly.
