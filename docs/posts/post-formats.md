Drawhisper supports multiple post types so you can experiment with pacing and tone.

## Longform stories
Ideal for lore drops and character diaries. Break content into short paragraphs and embed motion clips.

## Snippets and teasers
Use these to hype upcoming releases. Keep them under 280 characters and include a CTA.

## Multimedia drops
Combine stills, GIFs, and voice bites for immersive updates. Add accessibility notes for captioning and audio descriptions.
